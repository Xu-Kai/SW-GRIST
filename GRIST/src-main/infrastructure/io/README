list io generate same results
as original io
tested for both 1d, 2d
2d gcm is for gcm
2d is for grid generator
PiPatch is used on pi, that when comm_group_size is too large to write higher-than 2GB data,
this will write data step by step to please >2GB. In normal case (Default), ">2GB" can be avoided by 
setting comm_group_size=a small number like 10, 20; but PI sometimes does not accept such numbers for I/O.
