Global-Regional Integrated Forecast System (GRIST)
================================================================================
Home Page: https://grist-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

Model version: 1.0  
Code version: A23.6.26-p1  
Features: 
1. A unified global dynamical core that can switch between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic modes, coupled with a bespoke model framework suitable for general-purpose model development as well.  
2. Two physics suites (PhysW/AMIPW_Physics; PhysC/AMIPC_Physics) integrated with the dynamical core.  
3. Includes a 1D single-column model and a 2D shallow water model for testing physics and horizontal numerical operators, respectively.  
4. Extensively tested across various scenarios, including single-column mode, shallow-water mode, 3D dry/moist idealized dynamics, AMIP, NWP-style, and GSRM.  
5. Offers customized diagnostic templates tailored for specific applications (please refer to the GRIST tutorial for details).
