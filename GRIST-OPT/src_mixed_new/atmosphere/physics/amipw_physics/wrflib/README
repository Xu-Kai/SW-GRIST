Default setup at 2021-01:
RAD: RRTMG from v341

MP: WSM6 from v381 (lin/ylin can run less than 1 year, but abort for longer runs; seasonal run is ok)
BL: YSU from v381
SF: sfclay from v381
CF: CAM3
This set up has been tested for multiyear runs at 1d.
LSM: noahmp defined with WRF2_CLIMATE and WRF2_PHYSICS
update rad to v381, v341 cannot be compiled due to conflict, use macro selection

Default setup since 2021-04:
MP: WSM6V381 from v381 (LINV381, nspecies=5; MORR_TWOM_V381, nspecies=10) can be options, tested in UR and VR grids (e.g., G6, G8X16L4). Only WSM6 is tested for multiyear-climate integration.
BL: YSUV381 from v381
GWDO: V381 version combined with BL scheme.
CU: Tiedtke-Bechtold (ntiedtke) from v381
RAD: RRTMGV381 from v381 for SW and LW
SF: sfclay from v381
CloudFraction: CAM3; Xu-Randall; Binary; (choose accroding to different applications)
