!----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Created on 2016
! Version 1.0
! Description:
!     Definitions of discrete elements. Some elements are saved by 
! grid_generator (gg) or mpi_scvt, marked by "saved by gg". Other are evaluated 
! in the initilization process. Note that the dual cell is currently limited 
! to a triangle, that is, a Voronoi-Delaunay association. It can be generalized 
! to a polygonal cell. But given the current Staggered-FV numerics, there is no
! reason to deviate from an SCVT-optimized mesh, which is perhaps the best choice
! Note: all these element are deleted in 3D model runtime.
!
! Revision history:
!       1. For cubed sphere grid, some mesh weight may be obsolete as they 
! are specific to icosahedral grid; some weight may require rewrite
